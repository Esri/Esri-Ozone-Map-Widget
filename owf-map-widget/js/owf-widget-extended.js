/*
 * 
 * WidgetInstancePreference refers to preferences stored/retrieved for a particular
 *    instance of a widget on a dashboard.  E.g., if there are two Esri map widgets on
 *    on a dashboard, saving the instance preferences for one will keep its data unique 
 *    from the data stored for another.
 *
 * Because the original use case intended may include semi-sizable configuration data which 
 *    may be longer than the preferences API, this API also handles segmenting preference data
 *    and then recombining it upon retrieval.
 *
 * Caution: as with all preferences data, be wary of storing preference data that (1) should only be 
 *    viewable by specific users, as administrative users can see preference data, or (2) is considered 
 *    too sensitive to store in other than specially protected databases.
